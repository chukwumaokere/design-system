# Hooks

These hooks were written for general use. They abstract logic away from the render function and are generally pretty fun to use.

## useSize

Returns the bounds for a given element.

```jsx
const elementRef = useRef(null)
const elementBounds = useSize(elementRef)
return (
  <section ref={elementRef}>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </section>
)
```

## useIntersect

Returns the entry state (whether an element is in the viewport) for a target. The `IntersectionObserver` spec allows the target to be a NodeList but this hook only set the entry properties for the first entry, so beware I guess.

```js
const [
  ref,
  {
    boundingClientRect,
    intersectionRatio,
    intersectionRect,
    isIntersecting,
    rootBounds,
    target,
    time,
  },
] = useIntersect() // options can be added here.
return (
  <section ref={ref}>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </section>
)
```

## usePortal

Returns a target for a portal to attach to.

```js
const target = usePortal()
const [open, set] = useState()
return open
  ? createPortal(
      <section onClick={(e) => set(false) /* Close Portal */}>
        <h1>hello world</h1>
      </section>,
      target
    )
  : null
```

## useDates

Returns an array of dates of the current or specified month as well as actions to get the next and previous month.

```js
const [dates, next, prev] = useDates()
return dates.map((weeks) => weeks.map((day) => <h2>{day.iso}</h2>))
```
