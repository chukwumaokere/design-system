At Avail, we are constantly working to improve the tenant experience. For tenants, the dashboard provides a glanceable view of their status. Whether applying for a new rental or checking when their next rent payment is due, their dashboard should always provide this information.

The original tenant dashboard was cluttered with unnecessary information and outdated components. In order to make improvements we wanted, we needed to pay down some technical debt. This re-build would be essential to all future improvements and enhancements. Our design team took this as an opportunity to implement components from our design system, as well as streamline the application completion process.

### Simplifying The Layout

Users have enough to worry about as they apply to apartments and set up rent payments, we've simplified the overall layout to reduce visual noise and provide a more streamlined view of your activity. A single column allows users to scan the page more easily and allows Avail to bring important actions to the top of the page. We also surfaced your autopay status right on the dashboard for more transparency.

One of our biggest improvements in this project was reducing the five actions to complete an application into one, saving real estate and improving the process at the same time.

  application.

### Building Consistency

At Avail we've been working towards a deeper integration of our [design system](/packages) and updating the tenant dashboard let us build on that goal. You'll notice more consistency across elements along with added accesability.

Because tenants are often times accessing their account from their phones, we've added small enhancements to tie your account into your device, like one-click calling to your landlord.
