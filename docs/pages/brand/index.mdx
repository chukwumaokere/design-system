# Foundations

#### Our mission is to **build a community** of responsible DIY landlords and trustworthy tenants by providing them with education, end-to-end tools, and customer service to support them in their renting experience.

#### Our Approach

We take these brand values seriously in no small part because of the conversation they enable. Our values are great lenses through which to view, question and verify our work.
