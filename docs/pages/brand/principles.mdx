# Design Guidelines

We use design at Avail to create consistent, delightful, and intuitive experiences across touch points and sessions. We solve challenging interactions every day and our design language should be flexible enough to grow with our solutions.

### Stay out of the way

The more choices a person is presented with, the harder it is for them to choose. This is what Barry Schwartz calls The Paradox of Choice. Remove the “nice to haves” and focus instead of the necessary alternatives a person needs to make in order to greatly impact the outcome.

### Provide context

Context sets the stage for a successful delivery. By communicating how everything interrelates, people are much more likely to understand the importance of what they’re looking at. Ensure that the design is self-contained and doesn’t break people out of the experience except for when it’s entirely necessary to communicate purpose.

### Make things efficient

A primary goal is to make things efficient for our users before making things efficient for the system. Efficiency allows for productivity and reduced effort, and a streamlined design allows more to get done in the same amount of time. Creating efficiency demonstrates a great deal of respect for our customers, and they’ll be sure to notice. This means providing appropriate defaults and reducing the amount of steps needed to reach the user goal.

### Provide feedback

… Tell them why they’re waiting. Tell them that you’re working. Tell them you heard them and offer the next step along their path. Design is not a monologue, it’s a conversation.

### Prevent errors

Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
