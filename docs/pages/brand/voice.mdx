# Voice and tone

What’s the difference between voice and tone? We always have the same voice, but our tone should change depending on setting and situation. For example, our tone may be slightly playful in an email and more informative in a support email. But we always use the same overall voice.

#### Voice

`Conversational`, `Relational`, `Calm`, `Friendly`, `Thoughtful`, `Modern`, `Balanced`, `Approachable`, `Open`

#### Tone

### Trustworthy, not overbearing

#### Support

<LangExample
  accept="Please let me know if you have any trouble with this."
  reject="I’ll reach out again in a couple hours to make sure this is working."
/>

#### Marketing

<LangExample
  accept="We send rent reminders so you don’t have to."
  reject="Worried about tenants being late on rent? We’ll be the bad guy for you."
/>

#### Email

<LangExample
  accept="We’ll make sure your bank account information is safe."
  reject="We’ll never let anyone get to your bank account information."
/>

#### Content

<LangExample
  accept="To set your rent price, we recommend checking similar units in your market."
  reject="You must use our rent report to set your rent price."
/>

#### Product

<LangExample
  accept="We post your listing to the following sites."
  reject="If you don’t get enough applicants, we’ll intervene."
/>
